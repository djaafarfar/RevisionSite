        "answer": "The complexity is determined by the number of iterations the loop performs. If the loop runs N times, the complexity is $O(N)$."

        "answer": "A sequence of functions $f_n$ converges **uniformly** to a function $f$ if, for every $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists an integer $N$ such that for all $n \\ge N$ and all $x$ in the domain, $|f_n(x) - f(x)| < \\epsilon$."

        "answer": "Polymorphism means 'many forms.' It allows a single interface to be used for general class of actions. The most common forms are **method overriding** (runtime) and **method overloading** (compile-time)."
